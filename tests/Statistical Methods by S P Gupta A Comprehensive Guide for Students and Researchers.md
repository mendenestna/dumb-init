Statistical Methods by S. P. Gupta is a book that covers a wide range of topics in statistics, from descriptive statistics and probability to hypothesis testing and regression analysis. The book is written in a simple and lucid style, with plenty of examples and exercises to illustrate the concepts and techniques. The book also provides tables, charts, graphs, and formulas to help the readers perform calculations and interpret results.
 
The book is divided into four parts: Part I deals with the fundamentals of statistics, such as measures of central tendency, dispersion, skewness, kurtosis, correlation, and regression. Part II introduces the concepts of probability and probability distributions, such as binomial, Poisson, normal, t, chi-square, F, and Z distributions. Part III explains the methods of sampling and estimation, such as sampling techniques, sampling distributions, point estimation, interval estimation, and tests of significance. Part IV covers the advanced topics of analysis of variance (ANOVA), design of experiments (DOE), non-parametric tests, time series analysis, index numbers, and vital statistics.
 
Statistical Methods by S. P. Gupta is a comprehensive and practical guide for students and researchers who want to learn and apply statistical methods in their studies. The book is suitable for undergraduate and postgraduate courses in statistics, as well as for self-study and reference. The book is available in both print and digital formats[^1^] [^2^].

Statistical Methods by S. P. Gupta is not only a theoretical book, but also a practical one. The book shows how statistical methods can be applied to real-world problems and data sets, using various software packages such as SPSS, Excel, R, and Minitab. The book also provides case studies and projects from different disciplines, such as agriculture, biology, business, education, engineering, health, psychology, and sociology. The book helps the readers to develop their skills in data analysis, interpretation, and presentation.
 
The book is also updated with the latest developments and trends in statistics, such as big data analytics, machine learning, data mining, data visualization, and data quality. The book covers some of the most popular and useful techniques for dealing with large and complex data sets, such as cluster analysis, principal component analysis, factor analysis, discriminant analysis, classification and regression trees, neural networks, support vector machines, k-means clustering, association rules mining, text mining, sentiment analysis, and network analysis[^3^]. The book also discusses the ethical and legal issues related to data collection and usage.
